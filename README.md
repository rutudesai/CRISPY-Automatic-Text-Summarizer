# CRISPY-Automatic-Text-Summarizer
CRISPY is an automatic text summarizer created to understand the concepts of how text summarization works.

INTRODUCTION :

The internet is a vast source of information. The World Wide Web offers a large range of
data from which users can select relevant material for their purposes and wants. Therefore,
it is advantageous to use a practical text summarizing in this busy environment so that only
user-required information is supplied to the user in a shorter time. Because manual
summarizing of text documents and web contents takes too much time, automatic
summation of text documents and web contents is now necessary.
Text Summarization is extracting these summaries from the original huge text without losing
vital information. It is essential for the summary to be fluent and continuous and depict the
significance. Google news, the inshorts app, and various other news aggregator apps take
advantage of text summarization algorithms, which is a motivation for taking up this
challenging project.

The plan to solve our NLP problem of text summarization is in the following two ways:

1) Extractive Summarization

2) Abstractive Summarization

Implementation of a baseline approach was done using six extractive summarizations, which
are discussed in detail further in our report. The abstractive summarization module uses
more of a deep learning approach where the Bidirectional Seq-to-Seq LSTM model was
trained on the news dataset collected from thousands of CNN and Daily Mail news articles
from the early 21st century.
